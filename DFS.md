checksum : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checksum
A checksum is a small-sized block of data derived from another block of digital data for the purpose of detecting errors that may have been introduced during its transmission or storage. A good checksum algorithm usually outputs a significantly different value, even for small changes made to the input.
